## My experiments with ASR

This blog is dedicated to demonstrating some rather unconventional experiments which I try to do with my limited knowledge of modern Automatic Speech Recognition systems. I would like to know how people working in this area react to these experiments and hence would love to hear about any flaws or areas of improvement.

## About me

My name is Prakhar Swarup and I currently work at a reputable MNC (whose name I will not reveal intentionally!) in Hyderabad, India. I studied Automatic Speech Recognition during my Master's Thesis work at IIT Bombay and since then have been fascinated by it. In order to satisfy my curiosity, I tend to tinker around with some freely available speech datasets. Some interesting results of my tinkering can be found on this blog. Enjoy!!

## Kaldi ASR Toolkit

Kaldi is a widely used open-source toolkit used by researchers in the ASR domain. The core code is written in C++ and consists of routines for training of acoustic as well as language models, speech and text alignment and decoding of speech utterances (both offline as well as online) among other useful tools and routines useful in speech recognition research.
